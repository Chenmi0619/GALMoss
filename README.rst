Why you choose GalMOSS?  
===================================
**8000 galaxies fitting, in only 10 mins!**

Galaxies, the cosmic building blocks, comprise diverse stellar components like bulges, discs, bars, spiral arms, and nuclear star clusters. One of the primary motivations of galactic astronomy is to explore the structural and morphological properties of galaxies from their images, which are shown to be intrinsically correlated with the formation and evolution path of galaxies. As one of the analysis method, the surface brightness profile of galaxies, which involves fitting the light distribution with chosen parametric models, combines interpretability and quantification. As the volume of data from astronomical surveys expands, challenges arise in the field of galaxy light profile fitting. To counter this, we need a faster code for galaxy surface brightness fitting.

``GalMOSS`` is an open-source Python 3.9 package for analysing the morphologies and structures of large amount of galaxy samples. **GalMOSS** is available to do **parallel modeling** fastly and accurately.
