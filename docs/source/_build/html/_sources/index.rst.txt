Why you choose GalMOSS?
===================================

Galaxies are cosmic building blocks composed of different stellar components such as bulges, discs, and bars, each embodying unique evolutionary paths. So it is crucial to modelling galaxy structures relied on one-dimensional surface brightness. However, the escalating volume of data generated by contemporary telescope technology and various sky survey projects.To counter this, we need user-friendly and fast code for galaxy surface brightness fitting.

``GalMOSS`` is an open-source Python 3.9 package for analysing the morphologies and structures of large amount of galaxy samples. **GalMOSS** is available to do parallel modeling fastly and accurately, here we show a bulge+disk fitting result:
