**GalMOSS** a Python-based, Torch-powered tool for two-dimensional fitting of galaxy profiles. By seamlessly enabling GPU parallelization, **GalMOSS** meets the high computational demands of large-scale galaxy surveys, placing galaxy profile fitting in the CSST/LSST-era. It incorporates widely used profiles such as the SÃ©rsic, Exponential disk, Ferrer, King, Gaussian, and Moffat profiles, and allows for the easy integration of more complex models.
